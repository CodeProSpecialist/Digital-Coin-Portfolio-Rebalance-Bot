Legal Disclaimers

Important Notice: This information is provided as of October 28, 2025, and cryptocurrency markets, regulations, and technologies evolve rapidly. Always verify the latest information and consult professionals before using this bot.

No Affiliation or Endorsement: This trading bot is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by Binance.US or CallMeBot. All interactions with these platforms are at the user's sole discretion and risk, subject to their respective terms of service.
Not Financial, Investment, or Legal Advice: This bot and its description are for informational and educational purposes only. They do not constitute financial, investment, tax, legal, or professional advice. The author is not a financial advisor, broker, or registered investment advisor. All trading decisions are your sole responsibility. Seek independent advice from qualified professionals to assess suitability for your circumstances.
High Risk of Loss: Cryptocurrency trading involves substantial risks, including the potential for complete or partial loss of your investment. Prices are highly volatile, subject to rapid and unpredictable changes due to market sentiment, regulatory news, technological issues, or external factors. Past performance does not guarantee future results. You could lose more than your initial investment.
No Guarantee of Profits: Profits are not guaranteed. There is no assurance that this bot will generate profits or avoid losses. Trading strategies, including mean-reversion with momentum, oscillator, and trend filters, may fail in certain market conditions (e.g., high volatility, low liquidity, or black swan events). The 0.8% profit target is a goal, not a guarantee, and losses may occur due to fees, slippage, or unfavorable price movements.
Legal and Regulatory Compliance: Cryptocurrency trading is subject to U.S. laws, including oversight by the SEC (for securities-like assets) and CFTC (for commodities). As of October 2025, the CLARITY Act and FIT21 provide clearer jurisdiction, but users must ensure compliance with AML/KYC requirements under the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), sanctions screening, and state licensing (e.g., New York's BitLicense). Do not use this bot if prohibited in your jurisdiction. On October 17, 2025, the NFA eliminated certain disclosure guidance for digital assets but still requires disclosing material risks. Users are responsible for tax reporting (e.g., IRS Form 1099-DA for gains/losses) and any violations could result in penalties.
No Liability: The author disclaims all liability for any direct, indirect, consequential, or special losses arising from using this bot, including trading losses, data inaccuracies, third-party service failures (e.g., Binance.US API, CallMeBot), or security breaches. You are responsible for securing API keys and accounts. The bot interacts with third-party services; any downtime, errors, or changes in their terms are beyond control.
Software Risks and Warranty Disclaimer: The bot is provided "as is" without warranties of merchantability, fitness for purpose, or non-infringement. It may contain bugs, and users assume risks from technical failures, incorrect configurations, or unauthorized access. Test thoroughly in a simulation environment before live trading.
User Responsibilities: You must comply with Binance.US and CallMeBot terms, maintain account security, and monitor trades. Stop using the bot if it violates any laws or platform rules. This bot does not provide custody services; all assets remain under your control on Binance.US.
By using this bot, you acknowledge these risks and agree to indemnify the author against any claims.
